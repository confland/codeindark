# Conf.Land Code In The Dark

Let's have fun.

You have to do the same image in the bottom right of the editor without preview your code. In 15 minutes :)

## Start by get the editor
```
$ git clone https://github.com/confland/codeindark.git
```
Open the editor.html file locally. Wait for the start. And start coding.

## Rules
* No iframes, frameworks, snippets or other assets outside of the ones listed in the instructions are allowed. The site should be built from scratch during the competition.
* The contestant should have the editor in full screen mode, and is never allowed to exit out of it or use any measurement tools.
* Previews of the results are strictly forbidden until the time is over.
* Once the 15 minute timer runs out each contestant presents their result to the audience, who then vote on their favorite to decide the winner.

# Just to be sure - Rules
* No previews - of either results or assets!
* Stay in this editor at all times
* No measurement tools
* Stop coding when the time's up
* After the round is over, press "Finish" and follow the prompt instructions to see your results

And have Fun:)
